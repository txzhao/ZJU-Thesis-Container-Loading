# ZJU-Thesis-Container-Loading
This repo contains the main part of my bachelor thesis at Zhejiang University, 2016. It deals with the 3D container-packing problem, and successfully converts this problem into a 2D version. A greedy algorithm is then applied to obtain the optimal solution.

## Content
Simulation is realized using Matlab, and code for a graphical interface is done in C#.

## Reference
